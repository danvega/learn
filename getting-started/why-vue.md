# Why Vue?

Vue has quickly become one of the most popular JavaScript Frameworks and is a fan favorite among beginners.

## The Big 3

When you hear about JavaScript frameworks you usually hear about the big 3 which at the time of creating this course are Angular, React & Vue.

- [Angular](https://angular.io/)
- [React](https://reactjs.org/)
- [Vue](https://vuejs.org/)

When developers get attached to a certain framework they tend to get involved in framework wars and to make themselves feel better about their framework they put down other frameworks. I will not be doing that here and in fact I am here to say the frameworks listed above are all pretty amazing. The one thing I am really excited about is that each of the frameworks learn from each other and continue to evolve.

Each of the frameworks I mentioned is each really great for building applications from simple demos to large enterprise applications. In some cases, you might not have a choice what framework you choose because your employer or the project owner might have already made that choice for you. When you do have a choice it is up to you to check out the different frameworks and figure out which ones you like and what makes you most productive as a developer.

In this lesson I am going to tell you what I love about Vue and maybe those will end up being some of the same reasons you like it as well. I am also going to give you a quick overview of Vue and in the next lesson you will start writing some code!

## What I love about Vue

For me, the real power of Vue is just how welcoming of a framework it is. The core team has done an amazing job of making sure that developers of all skill levels can jump on in and be productive. As long as you are comfortable with HTML, CSS & JavaScript you can get started building some pretty powerful applications right now.

I also believe that of The Big 3 Vue has the lowest barrier to entry. There are a few reasons for this but for me, it comes down to 3 things

- Great Documentation
- Awesome Community
- Progressive Framework

### Documentation

When you ask most developers who enjoy using Vue I think one of the first things they will tell you is just how great the documentation is. If you head over to the Vue.js website you will find the docs broken down into a few sections.

- [Guide](https://vuejs.org/v2/guide/)
- [API](https://vuejs.org/v2/api/)
- [Style Guide](https://vuejs.org/v2/style-guide/)
- [Examples](https://vuejs.org/v2/examples/)
- [Cookbook](https://vuejs.org/v2/cookbook/)
- Tooling
  - [DevTools](https://github.com/vuejs/vue-devtools)
  - [Vue CLI](https://cli.vuejs.org/)
  - [Vue Loader](https://vue-loader.vuejs.org/)
- Core Libraries
  - [Vue Router](https://router.vuejs.org/)
  - [Vuex](https://vuex.vuejs.org/)
  - [Vue Server Renderer](https://ssr.vuejs.org/)

I would take some time to bookmark the main documentation websites. As you will find out they will be valuable resources

### Community

I feel like I have been a part of some amazing communities in my development career and the Vue community is no different. Everyone is very welcoming, friendly and beyond helpful. An easy way to see what others in the community are building or excited about is to follow some of them on Twitter. Here are 10 people I think you should start following today.

### Progressive Framework

If you visit the home page for Vue.js you will see it is known as "The Progressive Framework" and while it might seem like marketing mumbo jumbo at first, you quickly realize that it isn't. Let's start with the definition of progressive

> happening or developing gradually or in stages; proceeding step by step.

As you will see in just a minute you can take a very gradual approach to building Vue applications. If you have an existing project that you would like to add Vue too, no problem. You can start by dropping in a script tag and writing a few lines of code.

If you want to use a CLI to scaffold a new project out based on features you might need, also not a problem. As your application starts to scale and you need to add things like routing or state management it's really easy to do.

We talked about it earlier but Vue is an approachable framework. If you already know HTML, CSS & JavaScript you can get started today. If this is you let's jump on in and start writing some
