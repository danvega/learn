No matter what framework you're using you need to keep up on your JavaScript skills. The more time you can spend improving your JavaScript skills the better. This will make sure that you are able to use any framework or library thrown your way.

I mentioned the [guide documentation](https://vuejs.org/v2/guide/) earlier but it's worth mentioning again. This is the first place I would start and read through as much of this as you can but to also to make sure you're practicing the examples as you go. Repetition is an important step in the learning process and something that can't be overlooked. While you're going through the docs I would focus in on the core concepts of Vue.
