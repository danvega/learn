# Course Introduction

VueJS has quickly become one of the most popular JavaScript Frameworks. I know what you're probably thinking and I was thinking the same thing about a year ago. Not another JavaScript Framework! I'm here to tell you that this isn't just another framework and for me it's really made writing code fun again.

Learning something new can be overwhelming when you aren't quite sure where to start.

My motivation for creating this course is based on what I have seen from my {{$site.themeConfig.totalStudents}} students worldwide. Developers perceive hours of a course as value and I used to think the same way. What I have noticed in my course and in others is that students of these courses purchase them to learn a very specific topic. This is why you will see high enrollment rates in some of these large 12 hour courses but very low completion percentages.

With that in mind I have decided to move away from that model and develop courses with tarted topic and clear outcome. In this course and future courses you will have a very clear understanding of who will take this, what you will get out of it and how long it will take.

I have really fallen in love with Vue over the past year and I wanted to share my passion for the open source framework so I decided  to create this.
