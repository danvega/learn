# Setting up your Development Environment

Before we can dive in and talk about what the Vue CLI is and how we can use it we need to make sure that we have our development environment setup.

## NodeJS & NPM

## Vue Developer Tools (Chrome & FireFox)

## Visual Studio Code

### Visual Studio Code Extensions

This is a list of extensions and themes that I use:

- Vetur
- Live Share
